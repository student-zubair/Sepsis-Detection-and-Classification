# 🩸 Sepsis Prediction & Subtype Classification

This project predicts sepsis and classifies it into medical subtypes using machine learning (Random Forest, KMeans) and a Streamlit web app interface.

## 🔍 Features

- Sepsis classification 
- Subtype prediction using KMeans clustering
- Streamlit-based UI
- AI-generated treatment advice using Gemini API

## 📁 Project Structure

- `data/` - CSV files used for training and testing
- `models/` - Serialized ML models (`.pkl`)
- `src/Streamlit_App/` - Web app (Streamlit)
- `dev/` - Notebook for training and EDA

## 🚀 Running the App

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/student-zubair/Sepsis-Detection-and_Classification
cd Streamlit_App
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Server

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
